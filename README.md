## Hey, I’m Dmitrii 👋  

I leverage 20+ years of experience building long-lasting software systems – from high-growth startups to Amazon's scale.
My specialty is **business ontology and software architecture**, and my unique superpower is helping tech teams regain control over the complexity of their systems.

Currently, I am building:
- [Openize](https://openize.io) – an open-source dynamic configuration framework for large systems
- [Landing Drift](https://landingdrift.com) – a business intelligence system for investors to track how companies evolve their public message, positioning, and pricing over time.

Feel free to write me a line or two!
